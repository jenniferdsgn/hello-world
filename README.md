# hello-world

Hello World,

my name is Jennifer Meier and I am an Interior & Environmental Design student at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design.
I come from Bad Oeynhausen, Germany and I currently live in Dundee, Scotland. 

My interests include, but are not limited to, design, art, music, food, the outdoors, hiking and camping. I draw, skate and play football in my free time. 

I hope you are going to have an excellent day.
